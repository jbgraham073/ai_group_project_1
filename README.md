## Objective

Our objective is to identify the primary drivers of inflation within the United States economy. Subsequently, we aim to analyze the repercussions of inflation on various socio-economic factors such as crime rates, unemployment levels, and mental health.

To achieve this, we will employ a multiple regression model. Our dataset will consist of a time series comprising monthly data spanning either the past decade or two decades.

## Data sets

Publicly available economic, mental health, and crime data were collected from multiple resources (cited below), and cleaned using python and MS Copilot in pandas and jupyter notebooks. After cleaning, data discovery was conducted using visualization and statistical analysis.  

We have the following data sources with citations.

## Results and Summary of Analysis

# Economic Factors with Strongest Correlation to Inflation

Our original objective was to identify primary drivers of inflation within the United States economy. To examine this objective, we made a guess what economic factors might impact inflation, and also what social factors inflation might impact in the United States.
We did not find as many strong correlations of various economic variables with inflation as we had expected. There were only 3 total strong correlations with inflation out of 16 (tax income, unemployment (-), and anxiety. 

# The Impact of Inflation on Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Crime

Anxiety and larceny had more strong correlations than any other variable with the data sources we used, each with 10 out of the 16 variables resulting in strong correlations, from all 3 categories of economy, crime, and mental health.

# Prediction for Inflation for the next 2 years

Based on our analysis, we do however predict that inflation will continue to rise over the next 2 years. 

# Future Research Scope for the Analytics

Itâ€™s recommended to have more macro-economic variables and run it through a multiple regression model using Machine Learning skills to detect the key determinants of inflation for the effective monetary policy.
