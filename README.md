## Objective

Our objective is to identify the primary drivers of inflation within the United States economy. Subsequently, we aim to analyze the repercussions of inflation on various socio-economic factors such as crime rates, unemployment levels, and mental health.

To achieve this, we will employ a multiple regression model. Our dataset will consist of a time series comprising monthly data spanning either the past decade or two decades.
